# Intro

I am a software engineer at [GeoPsy Research](https://geopsyresearch.org) where I build scalable and sustainable tools, both internal and for external clients, for the most pressing needs in the society. I also engage in contract projects, the most recent one being [e-mita](https://emita.vercel.app). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, spatial imaging, social impact, and IoT. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At GeoPsy Research, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with clients, sell enterprise products, and build enterprise-scale products with technologies like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). I primarily work as a web and mobile developer but have broad experience across any software architecture.
